							<h3>Guests Arrive</h3>
							<p>Starting at 5:27, the guests began to arrive. First was Solomon McFlurry. When he arrived, the butler guided him to the library to read while he waited.</p>
							<p>Next to arrive were Anabell Jorgunsen and Yorick Littles. Having had previous business dealings together, they knew each other well and decided to ride together. Upon arrival, they were guided to the library to wait with Solomon.</p>
							<p>A few minutes later, Eliza Mirel arrived. Like the others, she was shown to the library to wait.</p>
							<p>At 5:58, as the group in the library were making their way to the dining hall for the meal, Jerry Sorielli arrived. He was led directly to the dining hall.</p>
							<h3>The Host Arrives</h3>
							<p>When all the guests were seated, the host of the evening Arthur Smith XXIV entered the hall. He went around the table, greeting the individuals personally. From there, he delivered a speech as the meal was brought out.</p>
							<h3>The Meal</h3>
							<p>The meal progressed as expected, conversation and laughter flowing freely. The meal consisted of several courses, and everyone was pleased with the dishes served.</p>
							<h3>Retiring to the Drawing Room</h3>
							<p>After the meal, the butler showed the group to the drawing room before retiring home for the evening. With him went the chef and both of the servants on hand.</p>
							<p>After a while of conversing, the group started to play games, starting with Charades, followed by riddles and a game of questions.</p>
							<h3>Mingling</h3>
							<p>After the games, everyone sat around talking, drinking, and simply having a relaxing time. After a while, Solomon and Anabell went for a walk, followed soon after by Eliza, Yorick, and Arthur. Jerry went to the libary and read.</p>
							<p>For several hours more, everyone mingled, made informal plans, and discussed politics and ideals. Throughout the night, people changed groups, mingling freely.
							<h3>The Body</h3>
							<p>Eventually, the group met up again to say goodnight, when they realized that somebody was missing. They looked around and discovered Eliza's body hidden in a closet off the second floor hall.</p>
							<p>Arthur immidiately called the police and we came over right away. We have collected reports from everyone here and have assembled the data for analyzing.</p>
